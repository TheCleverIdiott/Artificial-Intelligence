## 1st Exercise - Missionaries and Cannibals AI problem

### Τhe Nature Of The Problem
The Missionaries and Cannibals problem:

Three missionaries and three cannibals wish to cross a river using a two person boat. If at any time the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river, they will eat the missionaries. How can a sequence of boat trips be performed that will get everyone to the other side of the river without any missionaries being eaten?

### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to implement and solve the problem of Missionaries and Cannibals optimally using an appropriate search algorithm. 

### Implementation
A problem like this can be formulated as follows:

* States:
⋅⋅* Boat State (position):
⋅⋅* Game State (Missinaries and cannibals):
* Initial State:
* Syccessor function:
* Goal test:
* Path Cost:
In this project I implement a breath-first search.

### How to run it
