## 1st Exercise - Missionaries and Cannibals AI problem

### Î¤he Nature Of The Problem
The Missionaries and Cannibals problem:

Three missionaries and three cannibals wish to cross a river using a two person boat. If at any time the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river, they will eat the missionaries. How can a sequence of boat trips be performed that will get everyone to the other side of the river without any missionaries being eaten?

### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to implement and solve the problem of Missionaries and Cannibals optimally using an appropriate search algorithm. 

### Implementation
A problem like this can be formulated as follows:
* **States:**
	* **Boat State** (position): original is left coast and the final is right coast.
	* **Game State (Missinaries and Cannibals):** The number of Missionaries and Cannibals in the left coast of the river.
* **Initial State:** 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals in the left coast of the river.
* **Successor function:** All legal states where #Missionaries > #Cannibals on other side from trying the five actions (MM,CC,MC,M,C).
* **Goal test:** (aka Goal state) 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals in the right coast of the river.
* **Path Cost:** Each step costs 1, the path cost is the number of steps in the path towards the goal (Figure 1).
